# Robust Video Denoising

Implemented a patch-based video denoising algorithm capable of removing serious mixed noise from the video data by grouping similar patches in both spatial and temporal domain

Formulated the problem of removing mixed noise as a low-rank matrix completion problem, which leads to a denoising scheme without strong assumptions on the statistical properties of noise
